This is single page Front-end project from a challenge on frontendmentor.io.

The challenge was to transform screenshots of a webpage designed on figma into an interactive responsive web page.

For this challenge I used Next.js as my front-end framework and Tailwindcss as my method of styling elements.

The goal for me was to practice Next.js a bit more as this was only the second project i've worked on with Next.js.

The page has a nav bar with links and there are other articles and news headlines that have a hover effect that appear to be clickable but are just for aesthetic practice and dont really link to any new page.

This was all provided by Frontendmentor.io:

  - JPEG design files for mobile & desktop layouts
  - Style guide for fonts, colors, etc
  - Optimized image assets
  - README file to help you get started
  - HTML file with pre-written content
